## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### High-Risk Areas:
1. **Data Migration**: Risk of data loss during store migration
   - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive backup strategy, gradual migration
   
2. **Real-time Performance**: Risk of poor performance with many subscriptions
   - **Mitigation**: Subscription optimization, connection pooling
   
3. **Offline Conflicts**: Risk of complex conflict scenarios
   - **Mitigation**: Clear conflict resolution strategies, user choice options
   
4. **Authentication Issues**: Risk of user lockout or data access problems
